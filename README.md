# Simple GUI for Conway's Game of Life

**Version 1.0.0**

A simple GUI to simulate Conway's game of life.
It was a fast challenge from Holberton's senior engineer. I didn't have any idea how to create a GUI in python. It was pretty fun doing it during the day

Set the area size separated by commas.
Ex: 35, 45

Set a list of originaly alive cell as tuples separated by commas.
Ex: (10,10),(10,11),(11,11),(11,12),(12,11)

Use the button Go/Stop to run or pause the simulation.

Enjoy your cells :)
